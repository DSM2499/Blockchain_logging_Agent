# Blockchain Logging Agent

## Summary
As agentic systems and LLM-based architectures become more autonomous, the need for transparent, tamper-proof logging of agent behavior is increasingly critical. This project introduces a lightweight, modular Blockchain Logging Agent that leverages Ethereum to record agent actions and their underlying reasoning in a secure and immutable format.

By anchoring logs to a public or private blockchain, this system ensures traceability, auditability, and integrity â€” all vital for debugging, compliance, and trust in AI systems.

## Features
- Modular by Design: Plug-and-play architecture allows this agent to be integrated into any Python-based multi-agent or LLM-driven system.
- Immutable Logging: Uses Ethereum smart contracts to store action + reason hashes, guaranteeing tamper-proof records.
- LLM-Friendly Reason Capture: Designed to store LLM decision reasoning alongside the action taken.
- Log Verification: Includes tools to check blockchain logs and verify reason hashes against submitted input.
- Local or Testnet Support: Compatible with Ganache (for development) and Ethereum testnets for production testing.

## Use Cases
- **Audit Trails for AI Systems**: Maintain an immutable record of how decisions were made.
- **Governance & Compliance**: Demonstrate reasoning behind agent actions for internal review or external regulators.
- **AI Safety & Guardrails**: Track and analyze reasoning chains from LLMs to enforce boundaries and prevent misuse.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration Logs**: Record when, why, and how different agents contribute to a shared goal.
